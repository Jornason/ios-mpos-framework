# ios-mpos-framework
Mobile Point of sale framework for iOS for any PED (Pin Entry Device): Miura etc. With this, you'd only need to specify the PED (Pin Entry Device) you wanna connect to in the plist and also the response classes and you are good to go... Contact me (donaldking247@me.com) if more info is needed.
